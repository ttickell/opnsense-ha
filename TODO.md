  - [ ] Import IPv6 monitoring and validation tools

### 2.3 HA-IPv6 Coordination
- [ ] **Integrate IPv6 with HA state management**
  - [ ] IPv6 prefix delegation during MASTER state
  - [ ] IPv6 service shutdown during BACKUP state
  - [ ] IPv6 route management coordination
  - [ ] NPTv6 rule synchronization between nodes

### 3.2 File Organization Restructure
- [ ] **Reorganize file structure for OPNsense compliance**
  - [ ] `/usr/local/etc/rc.d/` for service scripts
  - [ ] `/usr/local/etc/rc.syshook.d/` for system hooks
  - [ ] `/usr/local/opnsense/scripts/` for OPNsense-specific scripts
  - [ ] `/usr/local/etc/` for configuration files

### 3.3 Integration with OPNsense APIs
